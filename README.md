The application, developed with the C# programming language and Oracle SQL Database, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural approach, serves as an internal system for the company. It features a multi-tiered structure with different roles, such as Administrator, Shift Leader, and Employee. Each role comes with specific constraints and functionalities, enabling users to efficiently handle diverse sets of data.

Additionally, the application utilizes dependency injection for streamlined interaction between components. Furthermore, there is an invitation and authorization system in place, ensuring secure and regulated user access to the application.
